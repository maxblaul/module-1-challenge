This is the repo for module 1 challenge assignment
Not going to lie I was a little confused with this assignment at first. I wasn't really sure which semantic tags to use and that kind of messed up the way my webpage looked for a bit. But after trying a combination of a few of them I figured out which ones were appropriate. The only thing that stumped me was for some reason the footer switched from being in the center to being on the right hand side. The CSS still tells it to be centered so I'm not really sure what I did wrong and where. Anyways here's the link:
